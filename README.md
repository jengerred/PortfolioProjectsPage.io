# PortfolioProjectsPage.io
## Description:
This page holds all my projects that I have been working on. I created photo buttons for each project as well as github link for each project. 
## How to Run:  
Click on any project or photo of project to view that project. Click on the github icon to go to the repository of that project.
## Roadmap of future improvements:: 
I plan to add much more projects and continue to work on and improve the projects that I have started.
